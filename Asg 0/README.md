In this assignment the most challenging part was getting the Github Webpages to work. It was the first time I've had to create it myself so I was a little lost, but fortunatley it led me to find some small bugs I missed the first round. 

My angleBetween and areaTriangle functions were provided by ChatGPT with some slight alterations to fit the specifications. 
Additionally the HTML file was completely redesigned by ChatGPT. The file was already in working order before the redesign, but I had ChatGPT give it a better UI design. 

Overall the assignment wasn't too difficult and I was able to implement all operations/inputs required.
