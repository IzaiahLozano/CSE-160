For this assignment I was able to cut in and out between videos as needed. However a few areas I had to figure out on my own since my 
implementation didn't match the professors. 

Of course, a good chunk of code came from the professor as well as the book.

After completing the assignment I ahd ChatGPT improve the UI and give it a nicer homier feel. Additionally, ChatGPT helped me witht he rotation 
rework for the Point.js file. 

My special addition was adding the rotation option. I didn't add it to the circle for obvious reasons. Although with less segments it could be 
useful but I decided not to.
